In the HomematicIP App this is called a \"Room\"</li> <li>Device: A hardware device e.g. shutter contact, heating thermostat, alarm siren, ...</li> <li>FunctionChannel: A channel of a device. For example DoorLockChannel for DoorLockDrive or DimmerChannel. A device has multiple channels - depending on its functions.</li> </ul> <p>For example: The device HmIP-DLD is represented by the class DoorLockDrive (or AsyncDoorLockDrive). The device has multiple channels. The base channel holds information about the device and has the index 0. The device also has a channel called DoorLockChannel which contains the functions \"set_lock_state\" and \"async_set_lock_state\". These are functions to set the lock state of that device.</p> <p>If you have a dimmer with multiple I/Os, there are multiple channels.

To test which commands are applicable for a channel, use the <code>hmip_batch</code> script. This script will try to execute commands for a device and print the result. It will also print the commands that are not applicable for the device.</p> <p>The script takes the device ID and the channel index as arguments. You also need a JSON batch file containing the commands.</p> <p>Warning Please pay close attention to the parameters used for each command. Incorrect or inappropriate parameters may lead to unexpected behavior or even malfunction of your HomematicIP devices. Executing commands is at your own risk.
