homematicip-rest-api
====================

A **Python 3** wrapper for the homematicIP REST API (Access Point Based)
Since there is no official documentation about this API everything was
done via reverse engineering. Use at your own risk.

Any help from the community thru e.g. Pull Request would be highly appreciated.

Documentation
=============
Documentation can be found under https://homematicip-rest-api.readthedocs.io

Installation
============

Just run **pip install -U homematicip** to get the package

"Nightly" Builds
----------------

each push on the master branch will trigger a build. That way you can test the latest version of the library with your systems.
Just run **pip install -U homematicip --pre** to get the package.

Usage
=====

First run hmip_generate_auth_token.py (from the command line) to get an
auth token for your access point. it will generate a “config.ini” in
your current directory. The scripts will look for a config.ini in 3
different locations depending on your OS. Copy the file to one of these
locations so that it will be accessible for the scripts.

Events
------

It’s also possible to use push notifications based on a websocket
connection

.. code:: python

    ##initialize the api
    #...
    #get the home object
    home = homematicip.Home()
    #add a function to handle new events
    home.onEvent += printEvents
    #enable the event connection -> this will also start the websocket connection to the homeMaticIP Cloud
    home.enable_events()


    #example function to display incoming events
    def printEvents(eventList):
        for event in eventList:
            print "EventType: {} Data: {}".format(event["eventType"], event["data"])

    #if needed you can close the websocket connection with
    home.disable_events()
